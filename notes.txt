Note:

Speed:

- max_speed is dynamically changed. It's HBot::m_MaxAbsSpeed
- user_max_speed is set to MAX_ABS_SPEED. It's just replaced by MAX_ABS_SPEED in aidenbot

Acceleration:
- max_acceleration: the only place that it's changed is in Camera::MissingStepsDetection(), but it's commented, so....
- user_max_accel = MAX_ABS_ACCEL
